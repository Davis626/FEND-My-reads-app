## Project Overview
MyReads app - project of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program.
Purpose of the project was to convert a static webpage from the starter code to an interactive webpage using React.

## Starter code
Starter code provided by Udacity:
> link https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter

## Backend Server

To simplify development process, there is provided a backend server for students to develop against. The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/utils/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods that will be needed to perform necessary operations on the backend like:
* [`getAll`](#getall)
* [`update`](#update)
* [`search`](#search)

## Important
The **backend API** uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
